# Space Unicorns
 
We are a little team of developers that we are amaking a simple 2D platformer game.

The inovations of our games are more technical that playables, because we implemented the code to read tilesets from extern sources and colliders from object layer from Tiled.

Here you have a link to our github repository to see more.
